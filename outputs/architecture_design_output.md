# ARCHITECTURE DESIGN REPORT

# System Architecture Document: @figma/my-make-file
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Date:** 2025-12-30
**Repository:** https://github.com/SanthoshDSR86/Youtubeappdesign.git

## 1. Executive Summary
This is a code bundle for YouTube App Design. The original project is available at https://www.figma.com/design/ujM3EK4OgxmDlhOnBOxIge/YouTube-App-Design.

## 2. High-Level Architecture
The system operates as a Component-Based Architecture.
The technology stack includes TypeScript, Next.js, React, Vite, FastAPI, Python, Uvicorn, Pydantic, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Redis, npm/yarn, and various dependencies.

### 2.1 System Context Diagram

    Data_Layer -->|Stores/Retrieves data for|> Business_Layer
    Business_Layer -->|Provides data to|> Presentation_Layer
    Presentation_Layer -->|Displays data to|> User
```

## 3. Endpoints Specification
Total Endpoints: 0
### Key Endpoints
No endpoints are available for this project.

## 4. Operational Workflows
The system operates as a Single Page Application (SPA) with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend. When a user interacts with the frontend, it sends a request to the backend, which then retrieves or stores data from the database. The backend returns a response to the frontend, which displays the response to the user.

## 5. Deployment & Security
The deployment architecture is not containerized and lacks orchestration, CI/CD pipeline, and cloud readiness. The security model uses JWT token authentication but lacks authorization layer, data protection, and security headers. The system has hardcoded secrets, which poses a high security risk.

## 6. Recommendations
* Add comprehensive testing strategy (unit, integration, e2e tests)
* Implement containerization with Docker for consistent deployments
* Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
* Implement monitoring and logging
* Add error handling and validation
* Consider implementing caching strategies
* Regular security audits and updates
