# ARCHITECTURE DESIGN REPORT

# System Architecture Document: @figma/my-make-file
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Date:** 2025-12-30
**Repository:** https://github.com/SanthoshDSR86/Youtubeappdesign.git

## 1. Executive Summary
This is a code bundle for YouTube App Design. The original project is available at https://www.figma.com/design/ujM3EK4OgxmDlhOnBOxIge/YouTube-App-Design.

## 2. High-Level Architecture
The system operates as a Component-Based Architecture.
The technology stack includes modern technologies such as React, Vite, and FastAPI, with a utility-first CSS approach using Tailwind. The backend is built using FastAPI and Python, with a relational database management system like PostgreSQL.

    end
    subgraph Business Layer
        FastAPI --> Python
    end
    subgraph Data Layer
        PostgreSQL --> Database
    end
```

## 3. Endpoints Specification
Total Endpoints: 0
### Key Endpoints
As there are no endpoints available, the following are some potential endpoints that could be implemented:
* GET /users
* GET /videos
* POST /videos
* PUT /videos/:id
* DELETE /videos/:id

## 4. Operational Workflows
The request lifecycle begins with the user making a request to the frontend. The frontend then sends a request to the backend, which processes the request and queries the database if necessary. The database responds with the required data, which is then sent back to the backend. The backend processes the data and sends a response back to the frontend, which finally sends a response to the user.

## 5. Deployment & Security
The deployment architecture is not containerized and does not have a CI/CD pipeline. The security model uses JWT token authentication and has basic security measures in place. However, there are some security risks, such as hardcoded secrets and a lack of authorization layer.

## 6. Recommendations
The following recommendations are made:
* Add comprehensive testing strategy (unit, integration, e2e tests)
* Implement containerization with Docker for consistent deployments
* Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
* Implement monitoring and logging
* Add error handling and validation
* Consider implementing caching strategies
* Regular security audits and updates
